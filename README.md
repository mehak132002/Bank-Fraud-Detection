# Bank-Fraud-Detection
This project focuses on identifying fraudulent transactions using ML techniques. Through this work, I explored and extracted valuable insights from the dataset and applied Logistic Regression to classify transactions as either genuine or fraudulent. Careful data preprocessing played a key role in improving model accuracy.

To make the project interactive and user-friendly, I developed a simple frontend using Gradio, a Python library that allows rapid prototyping of ML models with clean graphical interfaces.

Python

Logistic Regression

Pandas & Seaborn (EDA)

Gradio (for frontend)
